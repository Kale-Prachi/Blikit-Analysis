# Blinkit-Analysis
## Project Overview:
This project involves analyzing Blinkit's data to derive actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making. The analysis focuses on creating interactive dashboards and uncovering trends to enhance business strategies.

Chart Requirements :

1.Total Sales by Fat Content: Using Donut Charts, we analyse how different fat content levels impact total sales. This helps us understand consumer preferences better.

2.Total Sales by Item Type: Bar Charts are helping us identify the top-performing item categories. These insights are essential for fine-tuning inventory and marketing strategies.

3.Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales: With Stacked Column Charts, we compare sales across various outlets segmented by fat content. This allows us to tailor our product offerings more effectively.

4.Total Sales by Outlet Establishment: Line Charts enable us to evaluate how the age and type of our outlets influence total sales, guiding decisions on outlet development.

5.Sales by Outlet Size: Analyzing the correlation between outlet size and total sales using Donut/Pie Charts to optimize our outlet strategies.

6.Sales by Outlet Location: Assessing the geographic distribution of sales across different locations with Funnel Maps to understand regional performance.
